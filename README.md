This is the design files for ARKs version of the famous 40m Pixie QRP CW kit. We needed a RoHS version for our solder course, and therefore decided to make this implementation. 

This project is still under development. The next itteration wil hopefully come "soon". We will make the following changes:
1. Change the footprint of certain components to fit more available equivalent components.
2. Make the whole board larger to make more space for the components. That will make them easier to solder.
