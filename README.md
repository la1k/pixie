# pixie
This is is the design files for the pixie kit that we use for our solder course. 

This project is still under development. The next itteration wil probably come during the summer of 2018. We will make the following changes:
1. Change the footprint of certain components to fit more available equivalent components.
2. Make the whole board larger to make more space for the components. That will make them easier to solder.

Please note that we do not own this design. We don't know who does.
